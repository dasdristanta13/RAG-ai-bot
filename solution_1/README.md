# QA Bot

QA Bot is an advanced Python-based tool that answers questions based on the content of PDF documents. It uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to extract information from PDFs and provide accurate answers to user queries.

## Features

- PDF text extraction and processing
- Text chunking and vectorization for efficient retrieval
- Question answering using advanced language models
- Result caching for improved performance
- Slack integration for result posting

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that orchestrates the QA process
- `pdf_extractor.py`: Handles PDF extraction and vectorization
- `chain.py`: Manages the creation and usage of the QA chain
- `slack_post.py`: Manages posting messages to Slack
- `cache_manager.py`: Handles caching of question-answer pairs

## Usage

1. Place your PDF file in the project directory.

2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. The script will process the PDF, answer the predefined questions, and post the results to the specified Slack channel.

## Methodologies Used

1. **PDF Extraction**: We use PyPDFLoader from LangChain to extract text from PDF documents.

2. **Text Chunking**: The extracted text is split into smaller chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, which helps in more accurate information retrieval.

3. **Vectorization**: We use OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model to create vector representations of the text chunks.

4. **Vector Store**: Chroma is used as a vector store to efficiently store and retrieve relevant text chunks.

5. **Question Answering**: We use OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model in combination with a retrieval-augmented generation approach:
   - Relevant chunks are retrieved from the vector store
   - A contextual compression retriever further refines the retrieved chunks
   - The compressed context and the question are passed to the language model to generate an answer

6. **Caching**: SQLite is used to cache question-answer pairs, improving response times for repeated questions.

7. **Result Posting**: Results are posted to a specified Slack channel using the Slack API.

## Improving Accuracy

To make the solution more accurate, consider the following approaches:

1. **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune the language model on domain-specific data to improve its performance on your particular use case.

2. **Prompt Engineering**: Experiment with different prompts to guide the model towards more accurate responses.

3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models or approaches and use voting or averaging to determine the final answer.

4. **Improved Text Chunking**: Experiment with different chunk sizes and overlap to find the optimal configuration for your documents.

5. **Advanced Retrieval Methods**: Implement more sophisticated retrieval methods, such as hybrid search combining sparse and dense retrievers.

6. **Question Reformulation**: Implement a step to reformulate or expand the input question to improve retrieval accuracy.

7. **Answer Verification**: Add a verification step that checks the generated answer against the source text for consistency.

8. **Metadata Utilization**: Incorporate document metadata (e.g., section titles, page numbers) into the retrieval process.

9. **Context Aggregation**: Instead of using individual chunks, aggregate information from multiple relevant chunks before generating the answer.

10. **Regular Model Updates**: Keep the underlying models up-to-date as newer, more capable versions become available.

11. **Feedback Loop**: Implement a mechanism to collect user feedback on answer quality and use this to improve the system over time.

12. **Named Entity Recognition**: Incorporate NER to improve the handling of specific entities mentioned in questions and documents.
